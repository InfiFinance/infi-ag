## About

Its primary objective is to enable optimized token swapping experience on Pharos network by maximizing capital efficiency and simplifying user interaction. With its modular architecture, it identifies & executes swap paths that yield the optimal effective exchange rate across all DEXs on Pharos. The protocol features an advanced on-chain pathfinding algorithm capable of navigating multi-step routes involving trusted intermediary tokens

The protocol features a suite of smart contracts engineered to find the most efficient path for swapping one token asset (`tokenIn`) for another (`tokenOut`) across various Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). The core objective is to maximize the net amount of `tokenOut` received by the user for a given `amountIn` of `tokenIn`. This optimization considers not only the exchange rates provided by different DEXs and potential multi-hop routes but also optionally factors in the estimated gas cost associated with executing the swap path.

Pathfinding is performed using on-chain view functions (`findBestPath`, `findBestPathWithGas`) which query registered DEX adapters. While these query methods can be called by anyone off-chain to determine the best route before executing a swap, users should **avoid** calling these computationally intensive view functions within a state-changing transaction due to the potentially large gas costs involved.

The protocol utilizes a modular adapter pattern, allowing for easy integration and maintenance of different DEX protocols.
## Architechture Overview

### Core Components:

1.  **Adapter Pattern**: Adapters are specialized, individual smart contracts that act as translators or intermediaries between the generic InfiRouter and the unique interfeaces and functionalities of specific underlying DEX protocols
    
2.  **InfiRouter**: This smart contract serves as the primary entry point and central coordinator for the entire protocol. It handles state management, interface exposure, pathfinding logic & functions, swap execution, internal logic & administration.
    
3.  **Pathfinding Algorithm**: The core intelligence of InfiRouter lies in its on-chain pathfinding algorithm, implemented primarily within the internal _findBestPath function. This recursive algorithm systematically explores potential swap routes to identify the one offering the maximum output amount, potentially adjusted for gas costs. It utilizes a **recursive depth-first search strategy**.
    

### Pathfinding Algorithm:

The algorithm operates recursively as follows:

1.  **Base Case** - Direct Path Evaluation: The function first considers all possible single-step path. It iterates through every registered adapter.
    
2.  **Recursive Step - Multi-Hop Exploration**:
    
    – The algorithm checks if further exploration is warranted based on the maxSteps constraint. If the current path being built has length ( l ) and ( l < - 1 ), it proceeds to explore two-step (or longer) paths originating from the current state. – It iterates through each potential intermediary token in the TRUSTED_TOKENS list.

## Usage

### Router (`InfiRouter.sol`)

The `InfiRouter` contract is the primary user-facing interface for discovering optimal swap paths and executing trades.

See an example of off-chain usage for pathfinding and swap execution in `[./src/example.js](./src/example.js)`.

#### **`swapNoSplitWithPermit`**

Executes a swap similarly to `swapNoSplit` but utilizes EIP-2612 permit functionality. Allows the user to grant ERC20 approval for `_trade.amountIn` via a signature within the same transaction, saving gas compared to a separate `approve` call.

```solidity
function swapNoSplitWithPermit(
    Trade calldata _trade,
    address _to,
    uint256 _fee,
    uint256 _deadline,
    uint8 _v,
    bytes32 _r,
    bytes32 _s
) external payable; // Payable if swapping native currency
```

| :---------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_trade`    | `Trade`   | Swap execution arguments (same `Trade` struct as above).                                      |
| `_to`       | `address` | The address that will receive the final `_tokenOut`.                                           |
| `_fee`      | `uint256` | Optional protocol fee in basis points.                                                        |
| `_deadline` | `uint256` | Deadline (Unix timestamp) after which the permit signature is no longer valid.                |
| `_v`        | `uint8`   | Recovery identifier component of the ECDSA signature for the permit.                            |

### Adapters (`IAdapter.sol`)

Adapters serve as standardized interfaces allowing the `InfiRouter` to communicate with various underlying DEX protocols without needing to understand their specific internal workings. Each adapter implements the `IAdapter` interface.

Key Interface Functions:

```solidity
// Returns the expected amount out for a swap on the specific DEX
function query(
    uint256 _amountIn,
    address _tokenIn,
    address _tokenOut
) external view returns (uint256 amountOut);

// Executes the swap on the specific DEX
function swap(
    uint256 _amountIn,
    uint256 _amountOut, // Typically minimum amount for this hop
    address _tokenIn,
    address _tokenOut,
    address _to // Target address for the output tokens (next adapter or final recipient)
) external;

// Returns an estimated gas cost for executing the swap function
function swapGasEstimate() external view returns (uint256 gasEstimate);

// Returns the name of the DEX protocol
function name() external view returns (string memory);

```

To get a list of currently integrated and deployed adapters for a specific network, check the deployment scripts or configuration files within the `src/deploy` or relevant directories for specific adapter addresses per network.
